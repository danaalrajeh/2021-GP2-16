This is our graduation project, supervised by Dr. Khaoula Hamdi. 

Introducton:

A chatbot can provide support to patients living in remote areas or staying alone and replace the presence of a caregiver for simple tasks.
In our solution, we integrate a voice conversational chatbot. 

The app presents two views; one for the patient (voice chatbot only) and one for the healthcare service provider (web-based application).

Chatbots have the advantage of providing a human-like conversation that is suitable for elderly patients that have difficulties using technology or are technology illiterate.
The solution will provide support to discharged patients and allow healthcare professionals to gather patientâ€™s data and keep track of his medical history.
